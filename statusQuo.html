                <p>Since 1750, the carbon footprint of the world has been increasing steadily due to the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities. The industrial revolution in the 19th century marked the beginning of a significant increase in carbon emissions, which accelerated in the 20th century with the widespread use of oil and gas for transportation and energy production. The trend has continued into the 21st century, with global carbon emissions reaching an all-time high in recent years. This increase in carbon emissions has contributed to climate change and global warming, leading to a range of environmental impacts such as rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and changes in weather patterns. In response, there has been a growing focus on reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to cleaner, renewable sources of energy.</p>

            <div class="worldText">
                <p>As we can see, UWCCSC's carbon footprint has far exceeded the world's average. In terms of carbon footprint per capita, there's only one country which is higher - Canada. This may be because that the average living standards of UWCCSC community members are generally higher than the whole population of an entire country. All of us has constant and immediate access to food, electricity, and transportation, whereas in a country, there might be a large proportion of people who doesn't even have these accesses. Therefore, this may explain the data that we get now.</p>
